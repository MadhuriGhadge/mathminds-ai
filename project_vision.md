# MathMinds AI: Project Vision

MathMinds AI aims to become the ultimate personal math tutor — an intelligent agent that not only solves problems but also teaches the underlying concepts interactively.

### Core Idea:
An AI-powered math assistant that can:
- Understand handwritten equations and convert them into LaTeX.
- Solve complex math problems step by step.
- Explain concepts in a simple, personalized way.
- Use computer vision and data tools for real-world quantitative problems.

This project will combine Streamlit (for UI), FastAPI (for backend), and Gemini API (for AI reasoning) to create a complete, interactive learning experience.
